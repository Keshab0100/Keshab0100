### 🧠 about

just a developer trying to build cool stuff  
sometimes it works  
sometimes it becomes a learning experience™

- writing code
- breaking things
- fixing things
- repeating the cycle

---

### ⚡ currently

- building random ideas that feel interesting
- learning things i probably should've learned earlier
- optimizing life like it's production code
- drinking unhealthy amounts of chai ☕

---

### 🛠️ tools i usually touch

javascript | python | react | node
apis | databases | cloud stuff
git commits at questionable hours


---

### 🧩 philosophy

> ship first  
> overthink later  

---

### 🌙 fun fact

half my bugs disappear after restarting the server.

the other half become features.
